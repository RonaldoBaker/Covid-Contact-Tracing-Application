# Covid-Contact-Tracing-Application

## Overview
This is a console-based application that attempts to replicate the NHS COVID-19 Contact Tracing App during the COVID-19 pandemic using two main data structures - linked lists or binary search trees. This was originally completed as an assignment for a Programming module in Electronic & Electrical Engineering at UCL. This assignment was further developed and improved as a personal project to include more features. 

## 

## Further Improvements To Be Made
1. There is no error handling for the user input in the main menu - can crash program if string is entered
2. There is currently no rotation of nodes in the binary search trees - which would make search operations more efficient
